========================
OpenBelgium Master Theme
========================

This is a child theme of the BuddyPress bp-default theme. 
http://codex.buddypress.org/theme-development/building-a-buddypress-child-theme/


We override::

  header.php
  footer.php
  single.php
  style.css

And additionally provide function hooks in::

  functions.php
  shortcodes.php

...and that's it! Wordpress' output is modified via callbacks in functions.php. We structure the page in header/footer but aim to use the parent theme's templates in all other cases. Wordpress always provides a more robust override mechanism.


Templates
---------

**Magazine**

To create a magazine frontpage for your blog, create a page and choose 'Magazine' as its Template (on the right hand side).

Magazine mode will display:

* The latest blogpost with the category "Featured" at the top.
* The latest four blogposts which aren't that one beneath it.

The algorithm which displays a picture looks for "magazine.image" in the blogpost. Just add a HTML comment to your blog post:

  <!-- magazine.image = http://flickr.com/my/magazine/image.jpg -->

There is a simple algorithm to choose which category is displayed on the ribbon. This file decides which category will be chosen first:

To use YARPP to display Related Posts as magazine entries on the post view page, open up the YARPP widget settings.

* Disable "Automatically display related posts"
* Select "Display using a custom template file" (yarpp-template-magazine.php)


**Home**

The Home template adds Magazine style blogposts to the bottom of the page. Only posts in a category named "Featured" will be displayed. Images are handled in the same manor as described above.


**Presentation**

Display content in a series of slides. Example here: http://staging.okfn.org/slides/


Theme Options
-------------

The theme can be customised in a variety of ways via the Theme Options. These settings can be found in WordPress admin under Appearance >OKFN Master Theme Options. 


Supported Shortcode
-------------------

**Carousel**

To add a carousel to your page can be as simple as:: 

  [carousel]  
  [slide img="http://slide1.jpg" class="active"]  
  [slide img="http://slide2.jpg"]  
  [/carousel]  

Please note that one of the slides must have ``class="active"`` applied to it, this will be the first slide that is displayed.

Some predefined classes can be applied to the carousel to alter the styling::

  text-right photo-stack

Other supported attributes are ``heading`` and ``caption``. For example, to add a caption to a slide you would enter it as follows:::

  [carousel]  
  [slide img="http://slide1.jpg" class="active"]  
  [slide img="http://slide2.jpg" caption="My caption for slide two"]  
  [/carousel]
